# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project is a website hosted via GitPages. This page references a plethora of information about computer science, full-stack development, programming, as well as study tools.

I created this project as a unified way to learn about full-stack development, then directly applying those concepts to the implementation of my notation source. I wanted a way to access reference material on the go, in a consistent manner, as well as offer the opportunity to receive coveted feedback on my knowledge of programming and computer science.

The project offers an opportunity for new developers to refine their knowledge alongside me.

This project has been monumental in teaching me Git, hammering in a consistent workflow for programming, and how to link programming to a structural instruction framework like HTML + CSS.

## Usage

Currently, this project serves as a read-only webpage, with ambitions to add interactive features which will offer study and learning assistance. Tune in soon!

## Credits

[UC Berkeley Extension w/ edX](https://www.edx.org/school/uc-berkeleyx). The pre-work section for their Full-Stack Developer bootcamp offered a step-by-step tutorial for getting this project off the ground.

[Request-Reponse](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide), for their numerous walk-throughs, including a very helpful guide on how to write a README file!

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repository. In addition, please don't use this codebase for nuclear war, metagaming, or insisting that scotch tastes bad.

## Features

- Basic overview of HTML
- List of helpful `git` commands, to support a newcomer with the Git Fow
- Random topic generator to nudge a savvy web console reader to review a small subset of the information available

## How to Contribute

I would adore the idea of expanding this humble project into one which requires many developers. For now, the purpose of this project would be defeated if I opened the repository to more developers - otherwise I miss out on an opportunity to learn by doing!

The most helpful contributions would be:

- Correcting inaccuracies in the presented information
- Offering varrying levels of explanation (elementary school, high school, new CS/developer student, professional, PhD) for any concept here
- Feature suggestions
- Sharing links/resources to learn development concepts in-depth
- Mentorship opportunities (for me :D)
